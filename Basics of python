#this is for basic introduction to python 

# List:- this is array type structure like in other programming languages in python. Array is building block
# It is defined wiht square brackets []
l=[]        c
type(l)     #it show type of l, it return "<class 'list'>"

#list is mutable type and we can modify it as our requirement

#Tuple:-tuple is same as list, there is one difference that tuple is non-mutable.

k=()       #it create empty tuple and assign to valiable k
type(k)    #it show type of k, it return "<class 'tuple'>"
